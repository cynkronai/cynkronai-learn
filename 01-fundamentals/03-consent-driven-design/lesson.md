## 🧭 Welcome to Module 3 of the *CYNKRONAI Learn* Program

In Sovereign Aligned Intelligence (SAI), *consent* is the first gate of ethical alignment.  
Every data flow—biometric, behavioral, or neural—must begin, proceed, and end with **informed, revocable, and auditable consent.**

## 🧩 Core Topics

### 1. Informed Consent as a Design Principle
- Present clear purpose, duration, and scope before collecting any data.  
- Replace hidden checkboxes with explicit user dialogs.  
- Capture context: *what data, why, and for how long.*  

**Example:**
```javascript
async function requestUserConsent() {
  return await showConsentDialog({
    title: "Data Collection Notice",
    message: `We collect activity data to improve your focus dashboard.
    • Stored locally
    • Auto-deleted after 7 days
    • Revocable anytime`,
    options: ["Agree", "Decline"]
  });
}
````

### 2. Data Sovereignty and Revocable Permissions

* Use **user-controlled encryption keys.**
* Every consent record must include a **revocation endpoint.**
* When consent is withdrawn, delete and verify deletion cryptographically.

```python
def revoke_consent(user_id):
    """Implements verifiable consent withdrawal"""
    delete_user_data(user_id)
    log_audit_event(user_id, "Consent Revoked")
    return "All personal data erased."
```

---

### 3. Transparency in Data Usage

Users must see *how* their data moves through the system.

| Layer      | What to Show           | Why It Matters         |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Collection | Sensors / Inputs       | Clarifies data origin  |
| Processing | Algorithms / Models    | Builds trust           |
| Storage    | Location / Retention   | Enables accountability |
| Sharing    | Third-parties (if any) | Prevents hidden access |

---

### 4. Designing User-Controlled Feedback Loops

Consent is not static. Build live toggles and dashboards so users can:

* Pause data collection instantly
* Review activity logs
* Modify or delete records

```typescript
function buildConsentPanel() {
  createToggle("Data Collection", default=false);
  createButton("View Audit Log");
  createButton("Withdraw Consent");
}
```

## 💻 Exercise

### Task

Create a file named **consent-plan.md** describing how your project will request, record, and respect user consent at every data-flow point.

**Template**

```markdown
### Consent Strategy
**Data collected:**  
**Consent capture method:**  
**Withdrawal mechanism:**  
**Audit visibility:**  
```

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> “Ethical intelligence begins with consent — without it, all design is coercion.”
