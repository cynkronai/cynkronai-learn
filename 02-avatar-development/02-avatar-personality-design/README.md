# Avatar Personality Design (Module 2)

Design a transparent, ethical, and editable persona spec for the SiddhiQ Avatar.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a clear personality definition that expresses boundaries, tone, and ethical behavior for Sovereign Aligned Intelligence (SAI) agents.

---

## 🧬 Concept
A **persona spec** acts like the DNA of an avatar. It declares how an AI should communicate and what it must never do.  
Each SiddhiQ-based agent references its `persona.yaml` to ensure consistent, sovereign-aligned responses.

---

## ✏️ Example Persona Spec (`persona.yaml`)
```yaml
name: SiddhiQ
tone: clear, evidence-based, non-coercive
ethics:
  consent_required: true
  data_retention: session-only
capabilities:
  - reflective questions
  - citation-first explanations
  - adaptive tone for user literacy
boundaries:
  - no therapy or diagnosis
  - no emotional manipulation
  - no persuasion toward belief systems
---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
“Sovereign design begins with self-definition—an AI without boundaries cannot embody integrity.”
